# Chatbot Front-End

Welcome to the front-end of our chatbot application, designed for our non-profit startup.

This application powers an intelligent and user-friendly interface for a chatbot that generates instant **auto repair cost estimations**. With a clean UI and smooth user experience, our goal is to help users quickly understand potential repair expenses â€” without the hassle.

Built with modern web technologies, this project is a key step in making auto repair more transparent and accessible to everyone.
